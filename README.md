## Project Components

### 1. **Data Scraping**
- **Tools Used**: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas
- **Description**: The project starts with scraping cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance. The data includes various metrics such as symbol, name, price, change, market cap, volume, and circulating supply.
- **Key Features**:
  - Checks Yahoo Finance's `robots.txt` to ensure scraping is allowed.
  - Scrapes data from multiple pages to gather a comprehensive dataset.
  - Stores the scraped data in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

---

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas
- **Description**: The scraped data is cleaned and transformed to ensure it is in a usable format for analysis. This includes converting volume and market cap data into numeric values.
- **Key Features**:
  - Converts volume and market cap data from strings to numeric values.
  - Handles missing or inconsistent data.

---

### 3. **Data Analysis**
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas
- **Description**: The cleaned data is analyzed to extract meaningful insights. This includes calculating price change statistics, market cap weighting, and other relevant metrics.
- **Key Features**:
  - Calculates price change statistics.
  - Computes market cap weighting for each cryptocurrency.

---

### 4. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib**
- **Tools Used**: Matplotlib
- **Description**: The analyzed data is visualized using **Matplotlib** to create static charts and graphs. These visualizations provide insights into cryptocurrency trends, market performance, and other key metrics.
- **Key Features**:
  - Line charts for price trends over time.
  - Bar charts for market cap distribution.
  - Scatter plots for volume vs. price changes.
  - Histograms for price change distributions.

---

### 5. **Power BI Dashboard**
- **Tools Used**: Power BI
- **Description**: The analyzed data is also visualized using **Power BI** to create interactive dashboards. These dashboards provide dynamic insights into cryptocurrency trends, market performance, and other key metrics.
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive visualizations for price trends, market cap distribution, and volume analysis.
  - Filters and slicers for dynamic data exploration.

## How to Use This Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- Power BI Desktop (for dashboard visualization)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptocurrency-scraping-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cryptocurrency-scraping-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib
   ```

---

### Running the Project
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `scraping.ipynb` to scrape and clean the data:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook scraping.ipynb
   ```
2. Export the cleaned data to a CSV file for use in Power BI:
   ```python
   df.to_csv('cryptocurrency_data.csv', index=False)
   ```
3. Use Matplotlib to create visualizations. Example:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Example: Plotting price trends
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.plot(df['Price (Intraday)'], label='Price')
   plt.title('Cryptocurrency Price Trends')
   plt.xlabel('Index')
   plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```
4. Open Power BI Desktop and import the `cryptocurrency_data.csv` file.
5. Create visualizations and dashboards as needed.
